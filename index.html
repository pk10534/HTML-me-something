            <h2 class="Headlines">Getting there</h2>
            <p>To go to Peru, I flew out from Baltimore-Washington International Airport to Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and from there onto Lima! I used Spirit airlines, so the ride was slightly uncomfortable. However, they have an abundance of snack and drink options on board that make the flight a lot more bearable! From Florida, you should expect a 6-8 hour flighttime depending weather and other factors. </p>

            <h2 class="Headlines">First Impressions</h2>
            <p>What a change from the US! While many parts of Lima could be a bit dicey, the people were beyond nice and welcoming. Things were very cheap, and the US dollar will stretch very far in Peru, making this an ideal travel location for those looking for something exotic, yet on a tight budget!</p>

            <h2 class="Headlines">What to know...</h2>
            <p>Lima is filled with interesting activities for anyone, but it is important to speak at least some Spanish before visiting. Otherwise, you will likely have a hard time communicating with anyone while you are there!</p>
            <p>Another important thing to remember is to never drink the tap water: always bottled or boiled! I made this mistake and suffered for weeks!</p>
            <p>This is a weird factoid that trips up many Americans/Westerners visitng Peru, but do NOT flush your toilet paper - it will clog up the pipes. Always throw it in a trashcan beside the toilet</p>
            <p>Speaking of bathrooms, expect to pay to use public restrooms, similar to how it is done in Europe. It is usually very, very cheap and helps keep restrooms clean!</p>

            <h2 class="Headlines">Staying Safe</h2>
            <p>Lima is a wonderful city, but it is important to keep basic safety tips in mind: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>NEVER</b> carry your phone around: buy a burner if you can</li>
                <li><b>AVOID</b> displaying large amounts of money or jewelry in public, and be cautious with your ATM withdrawals</li>
                <li>Call an official cab company to get around, <b>DO NOT</b> use the oft overcrowded buses/vans commonly seen throughout Lima</li>
                <li id="Tip"><b>Most importantly, if a victim of a crime such as robbery, <b>ALWAYS</b> hand over what they ask for and promptly report it to police</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>I was robbed while in Lima, and although it was a scary occurence, I luckily had a cheap burner phone &#8209 and only carried small bills with me, minimizing my losses!</p>

            <h2 class="Headlines">What to do!</h2>
            <p>Lima is filled with activities such as swimming on La Costa Verde, museum-hopping in its historic downtown, and many shopping malls!</p>

            <h2 class="Headlines">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>While I have not been since 2018, I would gladly return at any point in time! It was truly an eye-opening experience and definitely taught me many things. I miss the people, the food and everything about it!</p>
